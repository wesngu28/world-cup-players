## Overview

This is going to be in story map format for UW Seattle course Geog 317, but I will probably convert it to a Mapbox web app.

This will be a combination repo containing the source files for my Geog 317 project and the web map Javascript version of it. The story map is only viewable by those in my organization (the University of Washington)

The World Cup is underway and is a huge sporting event for fans of football around the
world. Many athletes that participate in their national team, often the country of their birth, but
this is not always the case. These same athletes may also play for different teams like in the
Premier League or other clubs around the world. Some questions that could be examined with
this in mind are:

1. Which countries in the world have the most World Cup players?
2. How many players play for their birth nation as opposed to another at the world cup?
3. What countries do World Cup players play for outside of their national team?
4. Average age of world cup players, maybe even by nation since some countries have a
reputation of sending older players

## Visuals

From these, I can see some maps being made after geocoding country names into
countries. Most of these would be choropleth maps, like maps of countries by number of
player’s place of birth. Some charts I could highlight could be a chart comparing the amount of
players in a national team as opposed to the amount of players born in the national team’s
country to see which country has the most players from their own country as opposed to others
(for any circumstance).

I am unsure whether or not the data itself will require any external maps or satellite
imagery. I could see the informative parts, especially the exposition where the 2022 World Cup
is introduced, having some maps of Qatar and the stadium locations, but the data itself will
generate maps but not require maps.

## Overview

A personal project mapping the birthplaces of all the players at Qatar 2022, and some accompanying maps showing frequency per country, each country's highest appearance, and number of appearances. Also has some chart with various analysis.

The bulk of the analysis was a part of a project made for Geog 317, a class at the University of Washington where I had to make some ArcGIS story maps. Dataset was too good to waste on just that though.

## Local

Clone the repo and then run

```bash
npm install
npm run start
